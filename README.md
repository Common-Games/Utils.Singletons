# Documentation

Every bit of *public* API on the master branch of this package has been unit-tested and benchmarked.
But you should also run all unit tests yourself as they are included. 
We can never know if you have all the dependencies, your target platform, or your Unity version. 

The documentation is separated into these parts; 
- [Examples](#examples)
- [Overview API](#overview-api).
